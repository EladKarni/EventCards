# EventCards
A small tool that helps you programmatically create info cards for upcoming events on a public Google calendar. This let's you choose how many cards (events) you want to show. You can only show the next upcoming event, or the next 3, 4 ,5...

I tried to make the styling as generic as possible, but please feel free to make adjustments as needed in the CSS file.

## Getting Started

To get started, all you need to do is fork the repo and download it. It's all simple HTML, CSS and JS (Jquery).

### Prerequisites

Absolutely nothing! A good text editor is recommeneded, but even the defualt one built into your OS would work in a pintch.


## Deployment

To add this to an existing project, you need to reference the js and css files in your HTML. Add ``<div id="EventCards"></div>`` where you want the cards to show up.
